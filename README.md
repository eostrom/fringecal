# Fringecal

Fringecal scrapes the [Minnesota Fringe Festival 2011 web
site][fringe] and generates an iCalendar schedule of all the shows,
suitable for importing or subscribing with iCal, Google Calendar,
Outlook, and dozens of other calendar programs. Probably. I've only
tested it with iCal.

Unless you're adding features or fixing bugs, please don't run this
script - it'll just burden Fringe with unnecessary traffic. Instead,
just grab the [output file][schedule] from my web site, or import this
URL directly into your calendar software of choice:
